    overview: `Silken whispers dance on gilded air, where fountains hum forgotten melodies. Sun-drenched parterres dream of powdered wigs and whispered secrets. 

Zephyrs carry the scent of orange blossoms and clandestine rendezvous beneath sculpted hedges. Porcelain smiles linger in the echoing halls, a testament to fleeting grandeur. Crimson sunsets bleed across the Orangerie, painting the stone in hues of memory.

Let the rococo flourish, a flamboyant flourish upon the tapestry of time. Imagine carriages rolling down cobbled paths, their wheels a rhythmic counterpoint to the rustling leaves.

Even now, the spirit of extravagance breathes within these hallowed grounds, a playful phantom of elegance.`,
